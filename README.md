# Student DB (Database)
An application for student information storage.   [User Interface Doesn't Show Full Potential}
## About the Project
I built this project in IntelliJ IDEA, to showcase my Java comfortability. Its an inventory management application that allows for the viewing of data on individual students, including their math and reading test scores. The UI can be used to switch between three different database table views (students, reading scores, math scores).
